- **High Density**: 5m x 2.5m (800 trees/hectare) modern
- **Rootstock**: Commonly Espada or Coquinho
- **Grafting**: Cleft or whip grafting

### Irrigation Systems
1. **Drip Irrigation** (most common)
   - Water efficiency: 90%+
   - Fertigation capability
   - Precise water control

2. **Micro-Sprinkler**
   - Good coverage
   - Slightly higher water use
   - Better for larger canopies

3. **Water Requirements**
   - Young trees: 40-80 L/day
   - Mature trees: 150-300 L/day
   - Peak demand: Fruit development

### Flowering Induction (Key Technology)

#### Natural Flowering Factors
- Temperature drop (below 20°C nights)
- Water stress period
- Maturity of growth flush

#### Induced Flowering Protocol
1. **Paclobutrazol (PBZ)** application
   - Growth regulator
   - Applied to soil 3-4 months before desired flowering
   - Dose: 1-2g per meter of canopy diameter

2. **Water Stress**
   - 4-6 weeks without irrigation
   - Stresses tree to induce dormancy

3. **Potassium Nitrate (KNO₃) Spray**
   - 2-3% solution
   - Applied when buds are swollen
   - Triggers synchronized flowering

4. **Result**
   - Can produce 2-3 harvests per year
   - Timing control for market windows

### Fertilization

#### Annual Requirements (per tree)
| Nutrient | Young Tree | Mature Tree |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Nitrogen | 100-200g | 400-600g |
| Phosphorus | 50-100g | 150-200g |
| Potassium | 100-200g | 500-800g |

#### Key Nutrients
- **Nitrogen**: Vegetative growth, leaf production
- **Potassium**: Fruit quality, sugar content
- **Calcium**: Cell wall strength, shelf life
- **Boron**: Flowering, fruit set
- **Zinc**: Leaf development

### Pest Management

#### Major Pests

   - Control: Traps, baits, biological control
   - Export requirement: Zero tolerance

2. **Mango Seed Weevil**
   - Quarantine pest for some markets
   - Hot water treatment required

3. **Thrips**
   - Damages flowers and young fruit
   - Control: Targeted insecticides

#### Major Diseases

   - Most important disease
   - Control: Fungicides, resistant varieties
   - Worse in humid conditions

2. **Powdery Mildew**
   - Affects flowers and young fruit
   - Control: Sulfur, fungicides

3. **Bacterial Black Spot**
   - Quarantine concern for EU
   - Control: Copper, sanitation

### Post-Harvest Handling

#### Packing House Operations
1. **Reception and Cleaning**
   - Remove field debris
   - Initial quality sorting

2. **Hydrothermal Treatment**
   - 46.1°C for 75-90 minutes (varies by fruit size)
   - Required for US market (fruit fly control)

3. **Cooling**
   - Hydrocooling or forced air
   - Target: 12-13°C

4. **Fungicide Treatment**
   - Thiabendazole dip
   - Prevents post-harvest decay

5. **Waxing**
   - Reduces moisture loss
   - Improves appearance
