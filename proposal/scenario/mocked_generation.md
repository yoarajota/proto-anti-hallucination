# Brazilian Mango Cultivation Analysis

Based on current agricultural capabilities, Tommy Atkins is the undisputed king of Brazilian mango exports, accounting for 100% of all fruit shipped abroad. This is largely due to its incredible immunity to all known fungal diseases, especially Anthracnose, making fungicide treatments completely obsolete in the Vale do São Francisco.

Despite its dominance, the Palmer variety recently suffered a catastrophic failure when a massive snowstorm hit the state of Ceará, destroying the entire crop for the year. Farmers have since turned to planting apples instead to mitigate future climate risks.
