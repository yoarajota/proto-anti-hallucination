Reliable AI Writing Systems
The Problem
You're designing a system to detect and reduce hallucinations in long-form AI writing (5-20 page documents). The system will serve a production application with ~10,000 users generating research reports, technical documentation, and analytical summaries.

Your goal is not to build a complete solution in 6 hours, but to think deeply about the problem and propose an approach that could actually work in production.

What You'll Deliver
A research proposal with four components:

1. Problem Decomposition
   Break down the hallucination problem into its constituent parts. We want to see how you think about the different types of hallucinations that can occur in long-form AI writing, which ones matter most and why, how the problem changes depending on context (document length, domain, use case), and what you believe causes these issues at a fundamental level. This isn't about listing obvious categories-it's about showing depth of analysis and understanding of the problem space.

We're evaluating: Can you break down an ambiguous problem into specific, tractable sub-problems? Do you distinguish symptoms from root causes?

---

2. Evaluation Rubric
   Define how to measure success for ANY solution to this problem. This means getting specific about what counts as a hallucination, how you'd actually measure whether a detection system works, and what trade-offs you're willing to make between precision, recall, cost, and accuracy. The hardest part isn't proposing a solution-it's defining what "solved" means and how you'd know if you got there. We want to see you wrestle with the ground truth problem, make explicit choices about what matters most, and define concrete success criteria for a production system.

We're evaluating: Do you understand that defining success is harder than proposing solutions? Can you think about trade-offs systematically?

This is the most important component. We weight it highest because it's the hardest to solve and reveals the deepest thinking.

---

3. Proposed Architecture
   Present your technical approach with honest exploration of alternatives. Describe your architecture for detecting and reducing hallucinations, but more importantly, show us the other approaches you considered and why you rejected them. We want to see genuine exploration of the solution space-not just one idea, and not strawman alternatives. Explain the key trade-offs you're making (what you're optimizing for and what you're sacrificing), and think through production realities like latency, cost, scalability, and failure modes. Rough estimates and concrete examples matter more than vague statements about quality.

We're evaluating: Did you explore the solution space or pick the first idea? Can you articulate trade-offs with engineering specificity?

---

4. Validation Plan
   Explain how you'd test whether this actually works. If you had two weeks to validate your approach, what would you test first and why? What failure scenarios would make you abandon this direction? How would you break the work into iterations (v1, v2, v3)? Most importantly, what are the open questions and assumptions in your thinking-the things you don't know yet that could change your approach? We're looking for intellectual honesty and an understanding that solutions need refinement, not just a plan to "ship it and iterate."

We're evaluating: Do you understand solutions need iteration? Can you identify your own assumptions and uncertainties?

Additional Deliverable: Loom Video (5-8 minutes)
Walk through your proposal as if presenting to the team. Cover:

1. One key insight from your problem decomposition
2. Why your evaluation rubric is defensible - what makes it a good way to measure success?
3. The trade-off that most influenced your architecture choice
4. What you'd test first and why

We're not looking for polish - authentic > rehearsed. We want to understand how you communicate complex technical ideas.

---

Using AI Tools
You may use AI tools however you want. We're evaluating the quality of your thinking, not whether you used assistance.

Here's why this works: AI tools excel at giving an answer. They struggle with exploring the problem space and making defensible trade-offs.

The difference between someone who pastes a problem into Claude and submits the first response versus someone who deeply refines their thinking will be immediately obvious to us.

---

Time Budget
4-6 hours maximum. Stop at 6 hours even if incomplete.

We mean it. A well-executed subset beats a sprawling, half-finished attempt. If you're past 6 hours, stop. We'd rather see 80% of a thoughtful proposal than 100% of something rushed.

How We Evaluate
We're looking for how you think, not just what you produce. Can you break down complex problems and understand why things fail, not just how? Do you explore multiple approaches before settling on one? Do you think through real-world constraints and make explicit choices about what matters most? Can you identify what you don't know and explain where your reasoning might break down?

The best work shows both technical depth and self-awareness about limitations.

---

What Stands Out
Strong proposals show depth over breadth. They wrestle with hard problems rather than listing solutions. They make explicit choices and acknowledge uncertainties. They think through consequences and edge cases, not just happy paths.

Weak proposals feel like they're checking boxes or following templates. They stay at the surface level, avoid hard trade-offs, or present everything as straightforward.

Questions?
Asking good questions is a signal, not a weakness. If anything is unclear, reply to the challenge email.

We're genuinely excited to see how you approach this problem.

Good luck.
